# Querying the Groq API
To query the Groq API, you can use the following `curl` command:

```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:5000/query \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"provider": "groq", "prompt": "What is Docker?"}'
```

This command sends a POST request to the `/query` endpoint on `http://localhost:5000`, which is where the Groq API is running. The request includes a JSON payload with two key-value pairs:

* `provider`: set to `"groq"`, which specifies the provider to use for the query
* `prompt`: set to `"What is Docker?"`, which is the question or prompt to send to the API

## Prerequisites
To use the Groq API, you'll need to:

1. **Get a free Groq API key**: Visit the [Groq Console](https://console.groq.com) to obtain a free API key.
2. **Run the API on port 5000**: Ensure that the Groq API is running and listening on port 5000.

## API Endpoints
The Groq API supports the following endpoints:

* **Health checks**: (not shown in the example command)
* **Provider listing**: (not shown in the example command)
* **AI queries**: The `/query` endpoint, which is used in the example command above.

## Example Use Case
To query the Groq API and get a response, simply run the example command above. You can modify the `prompt` value to ask different questions or send different prompts to the API.

### Best Practices
When using the Groq API, keep in mind the following best practices:

* Always include a valid `provider` value in your API requests.
* Use a clear and concise `prompt` value to get the most accurate and relevant responses.
* Handle errors and exceptions properly, such as checking the API response status code and parsing any error messages.
